## Cryptocurrency project

The project aims to create a tool for managing cryptocurrency investments. It includes:
- a server part (available [here](https://github.com/QGarot/crypto-server)),
- a client part, providing a simple "single-page" UI.  
It is not ready for production because all planned features are not completed or implemented. The project is, of course open, for reuse and contributions.
